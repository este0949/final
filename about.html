        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am a student at Copenhagen School of Design and Technology and I am studying Multimedia Design. </p>
        <p>Before studying and living in Copenhagen I took a half gap year and moved from Prague, where I grew up, to London. I lived there for four months and during this time I had a chance to live outside of my comfortzone. To see what excites me and interests me. And to grow as a person.</p>
        <p>One of the things I am interested in and  in which I try to educate myself, is social media marketing. I had a chance to work on a campaign for an NGO called We care and  put my knoledge into use. </p>
        <p> For now, I still don't know what I want to do in the future as a job, however I believe, that my studies will help me to find my place.</p>
